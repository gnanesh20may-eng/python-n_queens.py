# N-Queens Problem – Python (Backtracking)

This project solves the classic **N-Queens problem** using a backtracking algorithm.

## Problem Statement
Place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
No two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
- Takes N as user input
- Uses backtracking algorithm
- Prints all possible valid solutions
- Displays total number of solutions

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Backtracking Algorithm

## How to Run
```bash
python n_queens.py
# python-n_queens.py
